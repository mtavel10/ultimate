This is an implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, a game my Dad taught me and 
my sisters to keep us entertained at restaurants. 

I want to use this project to teach myself C++. I got to play with object-oriented programming, looping and array indexing, and logical operations in C++.
I also created a test suite to ensure the game functions as it should. The logic and internal structures of the game are complete. I'm in progress of 
coding a playable UI version of the game. 

-------------- Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Rules --------------

In regular Tic Tac Toe, you win by connecting three in a row on a larger board. What makes this Tic Tac Toe game "ultimate" is that to claim a box,
players must win the tic tac toe game within that box.

"ULTIMATE" TIC TAC TOE

 
A player's move must be made in the corresponding grid to their opponent's last move. 
For example, the same starts in grid 0. Player EX puts an X in cell 5, so now
Player OH can make a move in grid 5.
